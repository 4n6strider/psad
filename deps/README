This directory contains perl modules used by psad.  These modules are included
to ease the installation process, but if psad is being installed on a system
where all necessary modules are already installed then it is recommended to
install from one of the psad "nodeps" tarballs or RPM's.  These distributions
of psad do not include any perl modules:
