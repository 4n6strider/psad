DESCRIPTION:

    The Port Scan Attack Detector (psad) is a collection of four lightweight
system daemons written in Perl and in C that are designed to work with Linux
firewalling code (iptables in the 2.4.x kernels, and ipchains in the 2.2.x
kernels) to detect port scans and other suspect traffic.  It features a set of
highly configurable danger thresholds (with sensible defaults provided),
verbose alert messages that include the source, destination, scanned port
range, begin and end times, tcp flags and corresponding nmap options (Linux
2.4.x kernels only), reverse DNS info, email and syslog alerting, and
automatic blocking of offending ip addresses via dynamic configuration of
ipchains/iptables firewall rulesets.  In addition, for the 2.4.x kernels psad
incorporates many of the tcp, udp, and icmp signatures included in the Snort
intrusion detection system (http://www.snort.org) to detect highly suspect
scans for various backdoor programs (e.g. EvilFTP, GirlFriend, SubSeven),
DDoS tools (mstream, shaft), and advanced port scans (syn, fin, xmas) which
are easily leveraged against a machine via nmap.  psad can also alert on
snort signatures that are logged via fwsnort (which makes use of the iptables
string match module to detect application layer signatures).  See the
"--snort-sids" command line option.

METHODOLOGY:

    All information psad analyzes is gathered from iptables/ipchains log
messages.  psad creates a named pipe (/var/lib/psad/psadfifo) and
reconfigures syslog to write kern.info messages to the pipe.  As log messages
are generated by iptables or ipchains, a separate daemon (called kmsgsd) reads
any messages that match a particular regular expression designed to catch
dropped/rejected packets out of the pipe and write them to a separate file
(/var/log/psad/fwdata).  psad is then responsible for reading messages as
they are generated from this file and applying the danger threshold and
signature logic in order to determine whether or not a port scan has taken
place, send appropriate alerts to /var/log/psad/scanlog, send alert emails,
and (optionally) block offending ip addresses.  psad includes a signal
handler such that if a USR1 signal is received, psad will dump the contents
of the current scan hash data structure to /var/log/psad/scan_hash.$$ where
"$$" represents the pid of the running psad daemon.

    NOTE:  Since psad relies on iptables/ipchains to generate appropriate
log messages for unauthorized packets, psad is only as good as the logging
rules included in the iptables/ipchains ruleset.  Usually the best way setup
the firewall is with a default "deny and log" rule at the end of the ruleset,
and include rules above this last rule that only allow traffic that should
be allowed through.  Upon execution, the psad daemon will attempt to
ascertain whether or not such a default deny rule exists, and will warn the
administrator if it doesn't.  See the FW_EXAMPLE_RULES file for example
firewall rulesets that are compatible with psad.

INSTALLATION:

    (See the INSTALL file in the psad sources directory.)

PLATFORMS:

    psad has been tested on RedHat 6.2 and 7.3 running kernels 2.2.14-5.0,
2.2.18, 2.4.0, 2.4.17, and 2.4.20, although it should work on any Linux system
that has a properly configured firewall.  The only program that specifically
depends on the RedHat architecture is psad-init, which specifically depends on
/etc/rc.d/init.d/functions.  For non-RedHat systems a more generic init
script is included called "psad-init.generic".  The psad init scripts are
mostly included as a nicety; psad can be run from the command line like any
other program.

Ipfilter support on *BSD boxes is coming soon.

Snort (written by Marty Roesch, see http://www.snort.org).
