#  This is the configuration file for psad (the Port Scan Attack Detector).
#  Normally this file gets installed at /etc/psad/psad.conf, but can be put
#  anywhere in the filesystem and then the path can be specified on the
#  command line argument "-c <file>" to psad.  Psad.conf is read by all
#  three of the psad daemons; psad, psadwatchd, and kmsgsd.  The syntax of
#  this file is as follows:
#
#  Each line has the form  "<variable name>    <value>;".  Note the semi-
#  colon after the <value>.  All characters after the semicolon will be
#  ignored to provide space for comments.

### Supports multiple email addresses (as a comma separated
### list).
EMAIL_ADDRESSES             root@localhost;

### Machine hostname
HOSTNAME                    _CHANGEME_;

### Specify the home network.  This variable is used to identify
### traffic that matches snort rules in the iptables FORWARD chain.
### Traffic that is directed to, or originates from, the firewall
### itself (i.e. in the INPUT or OUTPUT chains respectively) is
### treated as traffic to or from the HOME_NET by default and hence
### even if the HOME_NET variable is not defined, psad will still
### be able to detect matching scans.  A syslog and email warning
### message will be generated if this variable is not defined.
### Normally the network(s) specified here should match a directly
### network(s) on the local machine.  Multiple networks are supported
### as a comma separated list.  The network(s) should be specified
### in CIDR notation.  The following two lines provide example
### definitions for the HOME_NET variable.  NOTE: The HOME_NET
### variable is not used if there is only one network interface on
### the system (i.e. no traffic will be logged via iptables through
### the FORWARD chain).  If there is only one network interface on
### the box, then just set this variable to "NOT_USED".

### HOME_NET                192.168.10.4/24;
### HOME_NET                10.1.1.0/24, 192.168.10.4/24;
### HOME_NET                NOT_USED;  ### only one interface on box
HOME_NET                    _CHANGEME_;

### Firewall message search strings.  NOTE: the FW_MSG_SEARCH variable
### is now located in the file /etc/psad/fw_search.conf.  Edit this
### file to configure search strings for psad.  The change was made so
### that a single file could be reference by both psad and kmsgsd for
### search strings in iptables messages.

### Danger levels.  These represent the total number of
### packets required for a scan to reach each danger level.
### A scan may also reach a danger level if the scan trips
### a signature or if the scanning ip is listed in
### psad_auto_ips so a danger level is automatically
### assigned.
DANGER_LEVEL1               5;    ### Number of packets.
DANGER_LEVEL2               50;
DANGER_LEVEL3               1000;
DANGER_LEVEL4               5000;
DANGER_LEVEL5               10000;

### Set the interval (in seconds) psad will use to sleep before
### checking for new iptables log messages
PSAD_CHECK_INTERVAL         5;

### Search for snort "sid" values generated by fwsnort
### or snort2iptables
SNORT_SID_STR               SID;

### Set the minimum range of ports that must be scanned before
### psad will send an alert.  The default is 1 so that at
### least two port must be scanned (p2-p1 >= 1).  This can be set
### to 0 if you want psad to be extra paranoid, or 30000 if not.
PORT_RANGE_SCAN_THRESHOLD   1;

### If "Y", means that scans will never timeout.  This is useful
### for catching scans that take place over long periods of time
### where the attacker is trying to slip beneath the IDS thresholds.
ENABLE_PERSISTENCE          Y;

### This is used only if ENABLE_PERSISTENCE = "N";
SCAN_TIMEOUT                3600;  ### seconds

### If "Y", means all signatures will be shown since
### the scan started instead of just the current ones.
SHOW_ALL_SIGNATURES         N;

### XXX: try to mitigate the affects of the iptables connection
### tracking bug by ignoring tcp packets that have the ack bit set.
### Read the "BUGS" section of the psad man page.  Note that
### if a packet matches a snort SID (see SNORT_SID_STR variable)
### then psad will see it even if the ack bit is set.
IGNORE_CONNTRACK_BUG_PKTS   Y;

### Send email alert if danger level >= to this value.
EMAIL_ALERT_DANGER_LEVEL    1;

### Send no more than this number of emails for a single
### scanning source ip.
PSAD_EMAIL_LIMIT            50;

### If "Y", send email for all newly logged packets from the same
### source ip instead of just when a danger level increases.
ALERT_ALL                   Y;

### If "Y", then psad will import old scan source ip directories
### as current scans instead of moving the directories into the
### archive directory.
IMPORT_OLD_SCANS            N;

### Send scan logs to dshield.org.  This is disabled by default,
### but is a good idea to enable it (subject to your site security
### policy) since the dshield service helps to track the bad guys.
### For more information visit http://www.dshield.org
ENABLE_DSHIELD_ALERTS       N;

### dshield.org alert email address; this should not be changed
### unless the guys at dshield have changed it.
DSHIELD_ALERT_EMAIL         reports@dshield.org;

### Time interval (hours) to send email alerts to dshield.org.
### The default is 6 hours, and cannot be less than 1 hour or
### more than 24 hours.
DSHIELD_ALERT_INTERVAL      6;

### If you have a dshield user id you can set it here.  The
### default is "0".
DSHIELD_USER_ID             0;

### If you want the outbound dshield email to appear as though it
### is coming from a particular user address then set it here.
DSHIELD_USER_EMAIL          NONE;

### If "Y", enable automated IDS response (auto manages
### firewall rulesets).
ENABLE_AUTO_IDS             N;

### Block all traffic from offending IP if danger
### level >= to this value
AUTO_IDS_DANGER_LEVEL       5;

### Set the auto-blocked timeout in seconds (the default
### is one hour).
AUTO_BLOCK_TIMEOUT          3600;

### Enable iptables blocking (only gets enabled if
### ENABLE_AUTO_IDS is also set)
IPTABLES_BLOCK_METHOD       Y;

### Specify the position or rule number within the iptables
### policy where auto block rules get added.
IPTABLES_AUTO_RULENUM       1;

### Enable tcp wrappers blocking
TCPWRAPPERS_BLOCK_METHOD    N;

### Set the whois timeout
WHOIS_TIMEOUT               60;  ### seconds

### Set the number of times an ip can be seen before another dns
### lookup is issued.
DNS_LOOKUP_THRESHOLD        20;

### Set the number of times an ip can be seen before another whois
### lookup is issued.
WHOIS_LOOKUP_THRESHOLD      20;

### Enable psad to run an external script or program
ENABLE_EXT_SCRIPT_EXEC      N;

### Define an external program to run after a scan is caught.
### Note that the scan source ip can be specified on the command
### line to the external program through the use of the "SRCIP"
### string (along with some appropriate switch for the program).
### Of course this is only useful if the external program knows
### what to do with this information.
### Example:  EXTERNAL_SCRIPT       /path/to/script --ip SRCIP -v;
EXTERNAL_SCRIPT             /bin/true;

### Control execution of EXTERNAL_SCRIPT (only once per ip, or
### every time a scan is detected for an ip).
EXEC_EXT_SCRIPT_PER_ALERT   N;

### Disk usage variables
DISK_CHECK_INTERVAL         300;  ### seconds

### This can be set to 0 to disable disk checking altogether
DISK_MAX_PERCENTAGE         95;

### This can be set to 0 to have psad not place any limit on the
### number of times it will attempt to remove data from
### /var/log/psad/.
DISK_MAX_RM_RETRIES         10;
