# This file is used by psad to elevate/decrease the danger levels of ip 
# addresses so that psad does not have to apply the normal signature logic.  
# This is useful if certain ip addresses are known trouble makers and 
# should automatically be assigned higher danger levels than would normally
# be assigned.  Also, if psad can be made to ignore certain ip addresses
# if a danger level of "0" is specified in this file.

#  <ip address>  <danger level>
#
# Example:
#
#  10.111.21.23     5   # very bad ip
#  127.0.0.1        0   # ignore this ip
#
#  10.10.1.0/24     0   # ignore traffic from this entire class C
