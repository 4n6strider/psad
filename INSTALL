Installation notes:

	Before executing the install.pl script, edit the config sections
at the beginning of the psad, diskmond, kmsgsd, and install.pl scripts.
Sensible defaults are provided for each of the scripts so hopefully 
there will be a minimal number of things to change to get psad to work
on your system, but if system binaries are in places the scripts don't
know about then you will need to provide the correct paths.  After the
config sections are the way you want them, just run 'install.pl', and 
then run '/etc/rc.d/init.d/psad-init start' to start psad, kmsgsd, 
and diskmond, or just run them from the command line.  The install.pl
script installs psad, kmsgsd, and diskmond in /usr/local/bin/ by 
default.  

	Note: You can install a new version of psad over an
existing one; just run install.pl.
	
	Note: Even though it is a good idea to edit the config sections
of each of the programs included with psad, both install.pl and psad
attempt to use the correct system binaries even if an incorrect path
is given.  This is accomplished by simply using the path provided by
'which <system binary>' if the binary is not found in the place 
specified in the config section.
