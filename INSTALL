Installation notes:

	Before executing the install.pl script, edit the config sections
at the beginning of the psad, diskmond, kmsgsd, and install.pl scripts.
Sensible defaults are provided for each of the scripts so hopefully 
there will be a minimal number of things to change to get psad to work
on your system, but if system binaries are in places the scripts don't
know about then you will need to provide the correct paths.  After the
config sections are the way you want them, just run 'install.pl', and 
then run '/etc/rc.d/init.d/psad-init start' to get start psad, kmsgsd, 
and diskmond, or just run them from the command line.  The install.pl
script installs psad, kmsgsd, and diskmond in /usr/local/bin by default.
