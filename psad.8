.I psad 
\- The Port Scan Attack Detector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B psad [-D] [-d] [-o] [-e] [-f] [-r] [-S] [-w] [-l] [-K] [-R] [-V] [-i <interval>] [-h] [-c <config file>] [-s <signature file>] [-a <auto ips file>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I psad
makes use of ipchains/iptables log messages to detect, alert, and
(optionally) block port scans in real time. psad configures syslog to
write all kern.info messages to a named pipe 
.I /var/log/psadfifo
and then reads all messages out of the pipe that are matched by a regular
expression designed to catch any packets that have been 
dropped/denied/rejected by the firewall. In this way psad is supplied
with a pure data stream that exclusively contains packets that the 
firewall has deemed unfit to enter the network. For iptables 
firewalls in the 2.4.x series kernels, psad analyzes the tcp flags 
used in the scan to determine the scan type (syn, fin, xmas, etc.) 
and the corresponding command line options that could be supplied to 
nmap to generate such a scan. In addition, psad makes use of many tcp 
and udp signatures contained within the Snort intrusion detection 
system (see http://www.snort.org) to detect suspect network traffic such as probes for common 
backdoors, DDoS tools, OS fingerprinting attempts, and more. Psad 
features a set of highly configurable danger thresholds (with sensible 
defaults provided) that allow the administrator to define what constitutes 
a port scan or other suspect traffic. Email alerts sent by psad contain 
the scanning ip, number of packets to each port, any tcp or udp signatures 
that have been matched (e.g. "NMAP XMAS scan"), the scanned port range, 
the current danger level (from 1 to 5), reverse dns info, and whois 
information.

.I psad 
consists of four daemons: 
.I psad, kmsgsd, psadwatchd,
and
.I diskmond. 
psad is responsible for processing all packets that have
been denied by the firewall and applying the signature logic in 
order to determine what type of scan has been leveraged against the
network. kmsgsd reads all messages that have been written to the 
.I /var/log/psadfifo 
named pipe and writing any message that matches a
particular regular expression to 
.I /var/log/psad/fwdata. 
psadwatchd
is a software watchdog that will restart kmsgsd and/or psad should
either daemon die for any reason. diskmond is responsible for 
keeping track of the disk space utilization on the partition that 
contains the 
.I fwdata
logfile and will zero out the file as necessary
if the available space becomes less than a threshold defined by the
administrator.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.BR \-D ", " \-\^\-Daemon
Do not run psad as a daemon. This option is most useful
if used in conjunction with --output so that scan warning messages
can be viewed on STDOUT instead of being written to 
.I /var/log/psad/scanlog.
.TP

.BR \-e ", " \-\^\-error
Occasionally messages written by syslog to
.I /var/log/psadfifo
or to 
.I /var/log/messages 
do not conform to the normal firewall logging format. psad 
will write these message to 
.I /var/log/psad/fwerrorlog 
by default. Passing the --error option will make psad ignore 
all such erroneous firewall messages.
.TP

.BR \-d ", " \-\^\-debug
Run psad in debugging mode. This will automatically prevent
psad from running as a daemon, and will print the contents
of the %Scan hash and a few other things on STDOUT at crucial 
points as psad executes.
.TP

.BR \-i ", " \-\^\-interval\ \<seconds>
Specify the interval (in seconds) that psad should use to
check whether or not packets have been denied by the
firewall. Psad will use the default of 15 seconds unless a
different value is specified.
.TP

.BR \-o ", " \-\^\-output
By default all scan warning messages generated by psad are
written to 
.I /var/log/psad/scanlog. 
Passing the --output option instructs psad to write all error 
messages to STDOUT.
.TP

.BR \-f ", " \-\^\-firewallcheck
psad performs a rudimentary check of the firewall ruleset that
exists on the machine on which psad is deployed to determine
whether or not the firewall has a compatible configuration.
Passing the --firewallcheck or --Logging_server options will 
disable this check.
.TP

.BR \-K ", " \-\^\-Kill
Kill the current psad process along with psadwatchd, kmsgsd,
and diskmond. This provides a quick and easy way to kill
all psad processes without having to look in the process table or
appeal to the psad-init script.
.TP

.BR \-R ", " \-\^\-Restart
Restart the currently running psad processes.  This option will
preserve the command line options that were supplied to the original
psad process. 
.TP

.BR \-S ", " \-\^\-Status
Display the status of any psad processes that may or not be running.
.TP

.BR \-c ", " \-\^\-config\ \<configuration\ file>
By default psad uses configuration parameters that are
present within the configuration section of the psad script
itself. This can be overridden by specifying a configuration
file on the command line with the --config option.
.TP

.BR \-r ", " \-\^\-reversedns
Psad normally attempts to find the name associated with a
scanning ip address, but this feature can be disabled with
the --reversedns command line argument.
.TP

.BR \-w ", " \-\^\-whois
By default psad will issue a whois query against any ip from which
a scan has originated, but this can be disabled with the --whois
command line argument.
.TP

.BR \-L ", " \-\^\-Logging_server
This option should be used if psad is being executed on a syslog 
logging server. Running psad on a logging server requires that 
check_firewall_rules() and auto_psad_response() not be executed 
since the firewall is probably not being run locally.
.TP

.BR \-s ", " \-\^\-signatures\ \ <sig\ file>
The firewalling code included within the linux 2.4.x kernel
series, iptables, has the ability to distinguish and log any
of the tcp flags present within tcp packets that traverse
the interfaces. Psad makes use of this logging capability
to detect several types of tcp scan signatures included
within 
.I /etc/psad/psad_signatures. 
The signatures were
originally included within the Snort intrusion detection
system. New signatures can be included and modifications to existing
signatures can be made to the signature file and psad will import 
the change automatically without having to restart the psad process. 
Unfortunately tcp signature checking is not compatible with the 
ipchains firewalling code built into the 2.2.x kernel series due 
to the fact that ipchains cannot distinguish any tcp flags other 
than syn and ack.
.TP

.BR \-a ", " \-\^\-auto_ips\ \<auto\ ips\ file>
Occasionally certain ip addresses are repeat offenders and
should automatically be given a higher danger level than
would normally be assigned. Additionally, some ip addresses
can always be ignored depending on your network configuration
(the loopback interface 127.0.0.1 might be a good candidate
for example). 
.I /etc/psad/psad_auto_ips
provides an interface for psad to automatically 
increase/decrease/ignore scanning ip danger levels. Modifications
can be made to psad_auto_ips (installed by default in /etc/psad) 
and psad will import them without having to restart the psad process.
.TP

.BR \-l ", " \-\^\-local_port_lookup
By default for iptables firewalls psad will determine whether
or not your machine is listening on a port for which a tcp
signature has been matched. Specifying --local_port_lookup 
disables this feature.
.TP

.BR \-V ", " \-\^\-Version
Print the psad version and exit.
.TP

.BR \-h ", " \-\^\-help
Print a page of usage information for psad and exit.

.SH FILES
.I /etc/psad/psad_signatures
.RS
Contains the signatures psad uses to recognize nasty traffic. The
signatures are written in a manner similar to the *lib signature
files used in the Snort IDS.
.RE

.I /etc/psad/psad_auto_ips
.RS
Contains a listing of any ip addresses that should be assigned
a danger level based on any traffic that is denied/rejected by the
firewall. The syntax is "<ip address> <danger level>" where 
<danger level> is an integer from -1 to 5, with -1 meaning to ignore
all traffic from <ip address>, and 5 is to assign the highest danger
level to <ip address>.
.RE

.I /etc/psad/psad.conf
.RS
The psad configuration file is used if and only if the --config 
option is specified on the command line. Normally all configuration
parameters are specified within the configuration section of the psad
program itself. See
.I /usr/local/bin/psad.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following examples illustrate the command line arguments that could
be supplied to psad in a few situations:

Signature checking and automatic ip danger level assignment (best for
most situations):

.B psad -s /etc/psad/psad_signatures -a /etc/psad/psad_auto_ips

Disable the firewall check and the local port lookup subroutines; most useful 
if psad is deployed on a syslog logging server:

.B psad --Logging_server --local_port_lookup

Disable reverse dns and whois lookups of scanning ip addresses; most useful
if speed of psad is the main concern:

.B psad --reversedns --whois

.SH DEPENDENCIES
.I psad
requires that ipchains/iptables is configured with a "drop/deny/reject 
and log" policy for any traffic that is not explicitly allowed through.
This is consistent with a secure network configuration since all traffic 
that has not been explicitly allowed should be blocked by the firewall
ruleset. By default, psad attempts to determine whether or not the 
firewall has been configured in this way. This feature can be disabled with 
the --firewallcheck or --Loggine_server options. The --Logging_server option
is useful if psad is running on a syslog logging server that is separate 
from the firewall. For more information on compatible ipchains/iptables
rulesets, see the
.I FW.EXAMPLES
file that is bundled with the psad source distribution.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The --debug option can be used to display crucial information
about the psad data structures on STDOUT as a scan generates firewall
log messages. --debug disables daemon mode execution.

Another more effective way to peer into the runtime execution of psad
is to send (as root) a USR1 signal to the psad process which will 
cause psad to dump the contents of the %Scan hash to
.I /var/log/psad/scan_hash.$$ 
where 
.I $$ 
represents the pid of the psad process.

.SH BUGS
Send bug reports to mbr@cipherdyne.com. Suggestions and/or comments are
always welcome as well.

If $ENABLE_PERSISTENCE="Y", the scan data structures can become
large over time and consume lots of memory depending on the popularity
of your machine/site. Restarting psad solves this problem of course,
but a better way is on the TODO list.
