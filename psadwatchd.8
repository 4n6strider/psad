.SH DESCRIPTION
.B psadwatchd
checks on an interval of every five seconds to make sure that kmsgsd,
diskmond, and psad are running on the box.  If any of the three daemons
have died, psadwatchd will restart the daemon and notify each
email address listed in the EMAIL_ADDRESSES variable (see
/etc/psad/psad.conf) that the daemon has been restarted.
.B psadwatchd
uses the psad.conf configuration file which by default is
located at /etc/psad/psad.conf, but a different path can be specified
on the command line.
