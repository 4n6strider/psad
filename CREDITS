      script.

      facilitated the isolation of the pp_match bug to an older version perl
      on SuSE 8).

Joshua Jensen
    - Found bug with the manner in which fwcheck_psad.pl was being called
      from psad (improperly passing --no-fw-search-all option even if
      FW_SEARCH_ALL was set to "Y").

Mate Wierdl

      separated by commas).

    - Suggested the ability to have psadwatchd not send emails even if psad
      dies and has to be restarted.

Michael Hadjimichael
    - Bug report for syslog format that does not necessarily have the
      "kernel:" tag.

Blair Zajac
    - Submitted patch to not install perl modules in that are already
      installed in the system perl lib tree (he originally submitted this
      patch for fwknop).

Troy Swaine
    - Suggested a command line interface to block IP addresses.  The result
      is the --fw-block-ip argument.

      defined in fw_search.conf.
