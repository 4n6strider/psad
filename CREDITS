Manual Caphina          Greatly assisting in the first version of
                        Bastille-NIDS which eventually became psad.

Tim Schaller            Identifying and submitting a patch for a
                        particularly nasty bug for multiple scanned
                        ips.

Bruce Meyer             Psad testing and suggestions.

Peter Watkins           (Bastille Linux) psad/iptables interaction.

Sweth Chandramouli      (Bastille Linux) Various suggestions for psad
                        and install.pl, including help with various
                        Perl vagaries.

Jay Beale                (Bastille Linux) Excellent suggestions for
<jay@bastille-linux.org> psad reporting and enhanced security, and
                         also for integrating psad with Bastille.

Ramiro Morales          Developed all rpm packages of psad (see:
<rmrpms@usa.net>        http://rmrpms.tripod.com/psad/). Various
                        suggestions for psad installation (such as
                        FHS compatibility); implemented init script
                        patches.

Alexander Hoff          Psad stress testing for kmsgsd.

Ryan Delany             diskmond testing to help track down the
                        "rdev" bug.

Damien Stuart           Suggested the zombie reaper code for whois
                        processes, and uid/gid check.  Excellent
                        suggestions for coding practices and
                        strategies.

Donnie Armstrong        Suggested fix for incorrectly parsing
                        ifconfig output (might have previously
                        included ipv6 interfaces).

Ryan Bebeau             Suggested fix for AF_INET protocol error.

Cliff Rayman            Helped track down a nasty bug in which psad would
                        parse iptables messages that included a dns name
                        instead of just an ip address for the src and dst.
                        Performed lots of excellent testing and
                        troubleshooting.

Henry Jobst             Bugfix in install.pl for chomp error.

Ray Curtis              Found bug in kmsgsd for undefined $service lines.
                        Comprehensive testing to help remove bugs
                        including a difficult one in which psad gets
                        periodically restarted.

Manuel Santos           Contributed the first bug report to help
                        troublehshoot a potential bug in psad/whois
                        interaction.  Suggested the auto blocking code
                        should include support for tcp wrappers, and that
                        the auto-blocking alerts should be configurable.

L-P Sundqvist           Suggested fix for tab vs. space bug in install.pl
                        for /etc/syslog.conf, contributed design ideas to
                        make psad run on linux distros that use BSD-style
                        init scripts.

Eric Sawler             Suggested the ability to retain auto-blocked ips
                        even after a reboot.

C.Holman                Found, reported, and helped troubleshoot a bug in
                        the ipchains protocol number to name mapping.

Mike McCandless         Asked whether or not there is documentation for
                        the various psad configuration variables in
                        psad.conf.  The "PSAD CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
                        section of the man page was the result.

Jason Czerak            Found and submitted a fix for a bug in which an
                        ip would not be ignored even if it was given a
                        0 danger level in psad_auto_ips.  Also suggested
                        using the PREROUTING iptables chain along with
                        "-t mangle" for the auto-blocking code.

Colin Rose              Discovered and helped troubleshoot a bug
                        introduced when psad and bastille are installed
                        on the same machine (bastille installs an older
                        version of psad).

Ugo Viti                Discovered bug in auto-blocking code where the
                        subject line would incorrectly identify the
                        action that had been taken.  Discovered bug in
                        subject line for alert emails not including the
                        source ip if reverse dns did not work.  Suggested
                        adding the FORWARD chain to the auto blocking
                        code.  Found bug for email alert being reached
                        prematurely.

Leif Westlye            Discovered a bug where psad would not allow
                        commands to be different than the <cmd>Cmd name.
                        The bugfix allows someone to specify
                        "/usr/bin/mailto" for the mailCmd for example.

Daniel Gubser           Wrote the diskmond, kmsgsd, and psadwatchd man
                        pages.  Suggested compatibility mods for
                        syslog-ng.

Amelia Lewis            Provided information on syslog-ng configs.

Nick Temple             Suggested sending alerts to abuse.net.

James N. Winner         Discovered bug that prevented psad from detecting
                        scans through the iptables FORWARD chain.

Albert E. Whale         Discovered bug in 1.1 that made fw_check() too
                        strict with looking for precisely FW_MSG_SEARCH
                        in a logging prefix instead of just looking for
                        FW_MSG_SEARCH _within_ the logging prefix.

David Krider            Discovered iptables path bug on SuSE 8.2.

Ciapato Manfredi        Reported psadwatchd bug where multiple useless
                        processes were being spawned.

Ben Alcala              Helped troubleshoot diskmond utilization bug.
